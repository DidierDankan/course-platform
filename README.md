## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DidierDankan/course-platform.git
cd course-platform
```

---

### 2️⃣ Configure the Database

Before running the app, you must create the required tables.

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** or your preferred MySQL client.
2. Create a new database called `course_platform` (or the name you set in `.env`).
3. Import the `schema.sql` file located in the `server/db` folder.

```bash
# Example (using MySQL CLI)
mysql -u root -p course_platform < server/db/schema.sql
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
#### Backend:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### Frontend:
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create .env files in both server/ and client/ directories.

**server/.env**
```env
PORT=3001
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=yourpassword
DB_NAME=course_platform
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

**client/.env**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the App
**Backend (Express):**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Frontend (React + Vite):**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Then visit: **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

Profile images are stored in `/server/uploads/` and served at `/uploads/filename.png`

Skills & qualifications are stored in normalized tables (1 row per skill/qualification)

Uses unique constraints to prevent duplicates (e.g. same skill twice for one user)

---
